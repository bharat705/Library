# JavaScript Library

This project is a simple **JavaScript Library** application that allows users to manage their personal book collections. The project focuses on practicing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript and dynamically manipulating the DOM to display the books in the library.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Users can add new books by entering the title, author, number of pages, and whether they have read the book or not.
- **Display Library**: The library dynamically displays all books that the user has added.
- **Remove Books**: Users can remove books from the library.
- **Toggle Read Status**: Users can toggle the read status of any book in the library.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to reinforce JavaScript concepts such as:

- Object creation and constructor functions.
- Manipulating the DOM dynamically using JavaScript.
- Managing user inputs and events.
